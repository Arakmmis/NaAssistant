            if something has stopped functioning correctly, try pressing Refresh! again. If that doesn't help then
            reinstall the plugin.
            If a new character is released or a character has been updated then press Refresh! to repopulate the list.
            Refreshing
            may
            take a while!

            During battle you can select a character from this list to check out their abilties/chakra/cooldowns.
