The plugin is reviewed and uploaded on the Google Webstore for easy install: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naassistant/jmoneokkbkmcmnbenodlhfmblpjakmck

You can also just install this via github, download as ZIP file in the upper right corner, unpack, and load the folder in chrome chrome://extensions with developer mode turned on.

naruto-arena.net is not owned by me. This chrome plugin just edits the user's local view through html and js.

Have fun and Enjoy!
